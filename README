this program is drawing the tea pot with the Bezier curve
it will read file from the data/teapotCGA.bpt
and get the control point of each bezier patch
and draw the bezier curve
it has the bug that the each patch starts from the 0,0,0 position to 
draw bezier curve
otherwire it does work well
and just enter 'make' will compile the code and 
will able to run by enter 'BezierPatch'
